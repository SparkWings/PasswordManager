<h4>Introduction</h4>

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<hr />
This program, when set up, asks for one master password in order to show you all your other stored passwords; all of which can be easily added with a simple form.

In the event that the user -- or potential hacker -- enters the incorrect password a predefined number of times, the program will lock itself for a predefined amount of time.

The program offers a simple GUI, and makes all your password management easier than ever!

# PasswordManager
<h3>Java Swing Program that takes one password, and shows you all your other passwords!</h3>

This program, when set up, asks for one master password in order to show you all your other stored passwords; all of which can be easily added with a simple form.

In the event that the user enters their password incorrectly, the program will lock them out (1.0) and close.
*planned: multiple incorrect attempts will lock the program permanently*

The program offers a simple GUI, and makes all your password management easier than ever!



<h4>Stats for Nerds</h4>
<hr />

* The GUI is built with WindowBuilder, which can be downloaded from the Eclipse marketplace (Sorry InteliJ scrubs!)
* The password encryption is the AES algorithm, which is then stored in an unreadble format in a hidden file.
* Most, if not all calculations and algorithms process in less than 1 second
* Password View Buttons pyramid down -- meaning the program organizes the buttons accordingly, no clutter.

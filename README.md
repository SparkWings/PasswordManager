<h3>Java Swing Program that takes one password, and shows you all your other passwords!</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<hr />
Do you ever forget your passwords? Does remembering all your business, email, and website passwords give you a headache?

Ache no more! This program allows you to safely encrypt and store your passwords where you can only access them with one <b>master</b> password.

<br />
<br />

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<hr />
This program, when set up, asks for one master password in order to show you all your other stored passwords; all of which can be easily added with a simple form.

In the event that the user enters their password incorrectly, the program will lock them out (1.0) and close.
*planned: multiple incorrect attempts will lock the program permanently*

The program offers a simple GUI, and makes all your password management easier than ever!

<h4>Stats for Nerds</h4>
<hr />

* The GUI is built with WindowBuilder, which can be downloaded from the Eclipse marketplace (Sorry InteliJ scrubs!)
* The password encryption is the AES algorithm, which is then stored in an unreadble format in a hidden file.
* Most, if not all calculations and algorithms process in less than 1 second
* Password View Buttons pyramid down -- meaning the program organizes the buttons accordingly, no clutter.
